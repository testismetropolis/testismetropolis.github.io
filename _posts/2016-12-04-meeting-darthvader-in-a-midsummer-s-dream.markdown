Testismetropolis is my name, I'm here rapping and being your bane. 
Walking along the old-ass streets here, I feel like I'm in the 1940's, NY Penn.
Understand nothing but the cold of the winter breath, blowing in my face like a stormin' gust. 
Then boom, it goes boom, one piercing hit is all it takes, the lights shut out, dark as night. 
The watercooler's broken, ain't anyone coming to fix em'? Oh help, it gonna flood so bad in here.
No light, no water, we're running out of them survival essentialities. 
That pierce? That's right - a bullet in my back. 
I ran out aground that night.
